# TripletProt
Deep Representation Learning of Proteins based on Siamese Networks
+ In this work, we introduce TripletProt, a new approach for protein representation learning based on the Siamese neural networks trained over the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. 

### Applications
We evaluate TripletProt in protein annotation tasks including sub-cellular localization and gene ontology prediction, which are both multi-class multi-label classification machine learning problems.
