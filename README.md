# TripletProt
Deep Representation Learning of Proteins based on Siamese Networks
+ In this work, we introduce TripletProt, a new approach for protein representation learning based on the Siamese neural networks trained over the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. 

### Applications
We evaluate TripletProt in protein annotation tasks including sub-cellular localization and gene ontology prediction, which are both multi-class multi-label classification machine learning problems.

### Data
#### Function Prediction : http://deepgoplus.bio2vec.net/data/deepgo/data.tar.gz

We have used the following files:

test-bp.pkl
test-cc.pkl
test-mf.pkl

train-bp.pkl
train-cc.pkl
train-mf.pkl

#### sub-cellular localization

+ Multi Kernel SVM [1]
